Ammonia is a leading zero-carbon marine fuel candidate, yet no quantitative framework exists for sizing the port-level bunkering infrastructure -- shuttle vessels, pumps, and storage -- required to deliver it from production facilities to ship fuel tanks. We formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that jointly optimizes shuttle vessel capacity, bunkering pump flow rate, and year-by-year fleet expansion over a 21-year planning horizon (2030--2050) for three ammonia supply chain configurations at Busan Port: port-based storage (Case 1), remote supply from Yeosu at 86 nm (Case 2-1), and remote supply from Ulsan at 59 nm (Case 2-2). Demand grows linearly from 50 to 500 ammonia-fueled vessels at 12 voyages per year. The model identifies distinct optimal configurations: Case 1 selects a 2,500 m3 shuttle at a 20-year net present cost (NPC) of $290.81M and levelized cost of ammonia bunkering (LCOA) of $1.23/ton, while Cases 2-1 and 2-2 require larger shuttles (10,000 and 5,000 m3) at 2.4--3.0 times higher cost. A parametric break-even analysis establishes that remote supply becomes cheaper than port storage below approximately 59.6 nm one-way distance at the 10,000 m3 shuttle scale. Sensitivity analysis across four demand scenarios (250--1,000 end-vessels) demonstrates that optimal shuttle specifications are invariant, with LCOA varying only 5.7%. These results provide port authorities with quantitative decision tools for ammonia bunkering infrastructure investment in green shipping corridors.
