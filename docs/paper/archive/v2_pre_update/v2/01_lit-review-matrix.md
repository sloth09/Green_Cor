## 3. Narrative Synthesis

### 3.1 Ammonia as a Candidate Marine Fuel: Established Properties, Missing Operations Research

The technical viability of ammonia as a marine fuel has been established through multiple review papers and techno-economic assessments. Al-Enazi et al. [1] provided a comprehensive comparison of alternative marine fuels, identifying ammonia's advantages (zero-carbon combustion, existing transport infrastructure at -33 C) and disadvantages (toxicity, lower energy density than LNG). Imhoff et al. [2] quantified ammonia engine performance through thermodynamic simulation, establishing specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) values that feed into operational cost estimates. Kim et al. [3] evaluated the economics of ammonia-fueled propulsion for individual vessels, finding cost premiums of 1.5--2.5x over conventional fuels depending on ammonia price assumptions. Persson and Johansson [4] synthesized techno-economic parameters, and Wang and Wright [10] compared bunkering infrastructure requirements across fuel types qualitatively.

**What this body of work collectively lacks:** All five studies treat the bunkering supply chain as a fixed assumption -- ammonia is available at a given price and location. None asks *how* the ammonia reaches the vessel, what infrastructure is required to deliver it, or how that infrastructure should be sized. The supply chain between ammonia production and ship fuel tank remains a black box.

### 3.2 Green Corridor Planning: Strategic Vision Without Operational Detail

The green corridor concept has gained institutional support through the Getting to Zero Coalition [6], which identified Busan as a candidate port for a Korea--Australia ammonia shipping corridor. Lloyd's Register and UMAS [7] estimated fuel transition costs at a macro level, and Xing et al. [5] mapped decarbonization pathways for the maritime sector through 2050. South Korea has formalized green corridor agreements with the United States (Busan--Tacoma, targeting 2027) and is investing approximately $10 billion in Busan mega-port infrastructure including methanol and ammonia bunkering facilities. The Korean government's 2023 National Action Plan ("Toward Green Shipping by 2050") establishes policy targets but does not prescribe infrastructure configurations. Verschuur et al. [37] quantified the socio-economic and environmental impacts of green corridor infrastructure investments, demonstrating that corridor-level analysis can guide investment prioritization but does not resolve port-level bunkering fleet design questions.

**What this body of work collectively lacks:** These documents set targets (number of zero-emission vessels, percentage of green fuel) but do not provide decision-makers with quantitative tools to determine *how many* shuttle vessels to procure, *what capacity* those vessels should have, or *when* to expand the fleet. The gap between strategic planning and operational procurement remains unfilled.

### 3.3 Ammonia Bunkering: Beyond Yang & Lam

The most directly relevant operational study is Yang and Lam [11], who developed a discrete event simulation (DES) model for ammonia bunkering supply chains at port. Their model evaluates how the number and capacity of ammonia bunker supply vessels, bunkering flow rate, and demand level affect operational and economic performance. Key findings include: flow rate has up to 51.3% impact on bunkering service time (when varied by +/-50%), and the number of bunker supply vessels is the most sensitive parameter for annual operational cost (up to 15.2% effect).

**Where Yang and Lam [11] stops and our study begins:** Their DES model evaluates predefined configurations through simulation runs -- it answers "what happens if we deploy N vessels of size S?" but not "what is the optimal N and S?" Simulation identifies sensitivity; optimization identifies the minimum-cost solution. Furthermore, their model uses static demand (a fixed number of vessels requiring bunkering), whereas our MILP formulates demand as a trajectory (50 to 500 vessels over 21 years) with year-indexed fleet addition decisions. They also analyze a single supply chain configuration rather than comparing port-based storage versus remote supply alternatives.

A complementary body of work has emerged on ammonia bunkering safety, addressing the risk dimension that operational models must eventually incorporate. Fan et al. [18] developed the first Bayesian network-based quantitative risk assessment for ammonia ship-to-ship bunkering, finding that toxicity poses greater risk than flammability -- a result that informs safety zone design around bunkering operations. Yang and Lam [19] (in a separate 2024 study) extended this to multi-scale release analysis, showing that wind speed is the dominant factor for small/medium releases (up to 663% change in toxic cloud footprint per 50% wind speed variation), while hose diameter dominates large releases. Kim et al. [20] integrated STPA with Bayesian networks for port-level ammonia bunkering, identifying human controls and equipment integrity as critical risk factors. Qu et al. [35] proposed a comprehensive QRA framework for ammonia storage and bunkering at ports from TU Delft.

**What this safety literature collectively lacks:** All four studies [18, 19, 20, 35] focus on risk identification and mitigation, not on infrastructure sizing or cost optimization. None asks how safety requirements (e.g., exclusion zones, maximum transfer rates) translate into bunkering fleet design parameters. Our model's shuttle sizing and pump rate optimization implicitly affects safety through cycle time and transfer duration, but explicit safety-cost coupling remains a gap for future work.

More recently, Khan et al. [36] provided a comprehensive review of ammonia bunkering in the maritime sector, cataloguing technological, operational, and regulatory challenges. Their review confirms that no existing study has jointly optimized bunkering fleet size, shuttle vessel capacity, and pump flow rate -- reinforcing Gap 1. Wang et al. [38] formulated an optimization model for ammonia bunkering network configurations, representing the first application of mathematical programming to ammonia bunkering. However, their model is single-period (static demand) and does not include pump flow rate as a decision variable, leaving the coupled shuttle-pump-fleet optimization unaddressed. Dahlke-Wallat et al. [39] performed a techno-economic evaluation of ammonia bunkering infrastructure concepts at the 2024 IMDC, providing useful cost parameters for ammonia transfer equipment but without fleet optimization or multi-period planning.

At the strategic level, Trivyza et al. [21] designed a global network of ammonia-based green corridors, identifying optimal production sites, shipping routes, and bunkering ports. Fullonton et al. [22] surveyed shipping stakeholders on green ammonia adoption, finding that infrastructure availability and first-mover risk are the primary barriers. Both studies operate at higher abstraction levels than our port-specific model, but they provide the demand context and policy backdrop within which port-level bunkering infrastructure must be planned.

### 3.4 MILP Fleet Sizing: Mature Methods, Recent Advances, Different Domains

Mixed-integer linear programming for fleet sizing is a well-established methodology in maritime operations research. Fagerholt [8] demonstrated MILP-based fleet scheduling decision support systems for liner shipping. Christiansen et al. [9] surveyed the state of the art in ship routing and scheduling, noting the growing use of multi-period formulations. Fagerholt et al. [23] updated this survey through 2023, cataloguing over 50 papers on maritime inventory routing problems (MIRPs) and noting the trend toward stochastic and distributionally robust formulations, though none address bunkering infrastructure investment. More recently, Zhao et al. [17] jointly optimized heterogeneous fleet deployment, sailing speed, and fuel bunkering for green container shipping using MILP combined with multi-objective genetic algorithms.

In adjacent domains, Stalahane et al. [13] applied stochastic programming to the vessel fleet size and mix problem for offshore wind farm maintenance -- a structural analog where the decision variables (number of vessels, vessel type, dispatch schedule) parallel bunkering fleet sizing, though the operational context differs entirely. Vieira et al. [33] extended this to offshore supply vessel fleet composition with periodic routing and berth allocation, demonstrating that MILP formulations can handle joint fleet-infrastructure decisions -- though in a non-fuel context. Bakkehaug et al. [14] addressed multi-period bulk ship fleet renewal under demand and charter cost uncertainty using multi-stage stochastic programming, demonstrating that dynamic fleet expansion models outperform static sizing in volatile demand environments. Pantuso et al. [25] further showed that fleet renewal decisions under uncertainty benefit from stochastic formulations that explicitly represent scenario trees. Wang et al. [24] incorporated chartering flexibility into fleet composition, allowing tactical adjustment of fleet capacity through time charters -- a mechanism that could parallel shuttle vessel leasing in bunkering. Tan et al. [26] extended fleet sizing to include both time-chartered and voyage-chartered vessels under demand uncertainty for oil shipping, finding that charter flexibility reduces expected cost by 8--12% compared to owned-fleet-only strategies.

Two additional LNG bunkering MILP studies deserve attention. Jokinen et al. [42] formulated an early MILP model for small-scale LNG supply chain optimization along a coastline, determining optimal storage locations and vessel routes -- a structural precursor to port-level bunkering fleet design. More recently, Pratama et al. [40] developed a multi-period MILP for LNG bunkering vessel fleet sizing and scheduling, representing the closest methodological analog to our work: their model determines fleet additions over time under growing demand. However, both address LNG (not ammonia) and do not include pump flow rate as a decision variable.

The closest methodological analog in bunkering is the Turkey LNG study [12], which formulated a MILP for the ship-to-ship LNG bunkering supply chain as a "Multiple Period Maritime Fleet Size and Routing Problem." This model determines the number and size of LNG bunker barges and their optimal allocation under multiple demand scenarios.

**What these fleet sizing models collectively lack when applied to ammonia bunkering:** The Turkey LNG model [12] and Pratama et al. [40] address a fuel with fundamentally different storage physics (cryogenic at -162 C versus ammonia at -33 C or pressurized), and neither includes pump flow rate as a decision variable. Jokinen et al. [42] pioneered coastline LNG supply chain MILP but in a static, single-period setting. The expanded stochastic fleet sizing literature [14, 24, 25, 26] handles demand uncertainty but treats cargo transfer as instantaneous -- none models the flow-rate-dependent cycle time (shuttle_size / pump_rate) that defines ammonia bunkering system performance. Rodrigues et al. [34] compared uncertainty modeling techniques for maritime inventory routing but focused on inventory feasibility rather than infrastructure investment. Zhao et al. [17] optimize fleet deployment for existing liner services, not infrastructure investment for a new fuel supply chain.

### 3.5 LNG/Methanol Bunkering: Cross-Fuel Benchmarks

LNG bunkering infrastructure provides the most mature benchmark for ammonia bunkering design. Beyond the Turkey study [12], Park and Park [27] used integer linear programming to determine the optimal bunkering method (ship-to-ship, truck-to-ship, or pipeline-to-ship) at a single port, finding that ship-to-ship is optimal under the demand scenarios considered. Their model compares bunkering modes but does not optimize fleet size or expansion timing within the chosen mode. He et al. [28] optimized route, speed, and bunkering decisions for LNG-fueled tramp ships, demonstrating that alternative bunkering port selection reduces total operating costs when fuel price differentials exist between ports. Karatsidadou et al. [29] applied Monte Carlo simulation to LNG refuelling station design at Piraeus, finding that 3--5 stations maximize port profit -- an approach that parallels pump capacity optimization but uses simulation rather than MILP. Machfudiyanto et al. [41] conducted a feasibility study of LNG bunkering infrastructure at Indonesian ports, providing useful CAPEX and OPEX benchmarks for port-level bunkering investment that serve as cross-fuel reference points.

**What LNG bunkering literature provides for benchmarking:** The LNG bunkering vessel fleet expanded from 52 to 64 operational vessels between 2023 and 2024, with average vessel size of 8,225 m$^3$ and new orders trending toward 17,179 m$^3$. These fleet sizes and capacity figures provide useful cross-fuel comparisons for our ammonia shuttle sizing results (2,500--10,000 m$^3$ optimal). However, LNG bunkering operates in a mature market (641 LNG-powered ships in service by 2024) at fundamentally different scales than the nascent ammonia bunkering market (39 ammonia-capable vessels on order by 2025).

**What LNG models cannot address for ammonia:** LNG storage at -162 C requires different tank insulation, boil-off management, and transfer equipment than ammonia at -33 C. LNG bunkering models do not account for ammonia's toxicity-driven safety zone requirements, which constrain where and when bunkering can occur. The pump rate dynamics differ: ammonia's lower viscosity and higher density at storage temperature allow faster volumetric transfer rates but introduce different containment challenges.

### 3.6 Ammonia Supply Chain and Cost Projections: Global Scale, Not Port-Level Bunkering

At the supply chain level, Galan-Martin et al. [15] formulated a MILP to optimize green ammonia distribution systems for intercontinental energy transport, determining optimal producer locations given global demand patterns. Their model spans continents and decades, incorporating production capacity, shipping routes, and terminal infrastructure. Kim et al. [16] performed a techno-economic analysis of ammonia ocean transport, estimating per-ton shipping costs but without fleet sizing optimization.

Wang et al. [43] applied stochastic optimization to ammonia production and supply chain design under uncertainty, providing cost parameters for ammonia distribution that complement our bunkering-focused LCOA estimates.

Recent cost projections provide essential input parameters for bunkering infrastructure models. IRENA [31] projects green ammonia costs declining from $720--$1,400/ton (2022) to $310--$610/ton by 2050, with $480/ton achievable by 2030 under favorable conditions. The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies [32] evaluated e-ammonia production costs for maritime applications, finding that electrolyzer costs and renewable electricity prices dominate the levelized cost of ammonia (LCOA), with production contributing over 79% of total delivered cost. Fullonton et al. [22] surveyed the full ammonia fuel supply chain from a stakeholder perspective, identifying infrastructure availability and first-mover risk as primary adoption barriers. The IMO's 2023 revised GHG strategy [30] sets binding targets (30% emission reduction by 2030, 80% by 2040, net-zero by 2050 relative to 2008) that create the policy framework driving ammonia demand growth.

**What these supply chain models and projections collectively lack:** They operate at spatial scales (intercontinental routes, national networks) and decision granularities (which countries to produce in, which ports to ship from) that are irrelevant to the port-level question: given that ammonia will arrive at or near Busan, how should the last-mile bunkering infrastructure -- shuttle vessels, pumps, storage -- be configured? Our fuel price assumption of $600/ton falls within the projected 2030--2040 range ($310--$660/ton), and our bunkering LCOA ($1.23/ton for Case 1) represents approximately 0.2% of total ammonia fuel cost -- confirming that bunkering logistics, while operationally complex, are not the dominant cost barrier.

### 3.7 Synthesis: The Unfilled Intersection

The expanded literature (43 papers) falls into three non-overlapping clusters:

**Cluster A (Ammonia knowledge, no optimization):** Papers [1]--[7], [10], [16], [18]--[22], [30]--[32], [35], [36], [39], [43] establish that ammonia is a viable marine fuel, quantify bunkering safety risks, identify infrastructure constraints, and project cost trajectories. The safety sub-cluster [18, 19, 20, 35] has grown rapidly since 2022 but remains disconnected from infrastructure sizing. Khan et al. [36] provide the most comprehensive ammonia bunkering review to date (2025), confirming that no joint optimization study exists. Dahlke-Wallat et al. [39] contribute techno-economic parameters for ammonia bunkering concepts. Wang et al. [43] address ammonia supply chain design under uncertainty but at the production level, not port-level bunkering. Policy and TEA sources [22, 30, 31, 32, 37] provide demand context and cost parameters but not decision tools.

**Cluster B (Optimization methods, not ammonia bunkering):** Papers [8], [9], [12]--[14], [17], [23]--[29], [33], [34], [40]--[42] demonstrate that MILP and stochastic programming can effectively solve fleet sizing, inventory routing, and multi-period expansion problems. This cluster has matured significantly: Fagerholt et al. [23] survey over 50 MIRP papers through 2023; stochastic fleet sizing now handles demand uncertainty [25, 26], charter flexibility [24], and carbon constraints [17]. LNG bunkering models [12, 27, 28, 29, 40, 41, 42] are the closest domain analogs, with Pratama et al. [40] providing a multi-period LNG bunkering fleet MILP and Jokinen et al. [42] an early coastline LNG supply chain MILP. Yet none of these papers addresses ammonia-specific transfer dynamics or bunkering infrastructure investment.

**The bridge (partial):** Yang and Lam [11] directly address ammonia bunkering operations with a quantitative model, but use simulation rather than optimization and do not address multi-period fleet expansion or supply chain configuration comparison. Wang et al. [38] apply optimization to ammonia bunkering networks -- the closest to our work -- but in a single-period setting without pump rate as a decision variable. Trivyza et al. [21] design ammonia-based green corridor networks but at global scale. Galan-Martin et al. [15] apply MILP to ammonia distribution but for intercontinental transport, not port-level bunkering.

**What remains unaddressed after reviewing 43 papers:**

1. **No paper** jointly optimizes shuttle vessel size, bunkering pump flow rate, and fleet count for ammonia -- the three coupled variables that define bunkering system performance. Wang et al. [38] optimize ammonia bunkering network configurations but in a single-period setting without pump rate as a decision variable. Even the most advanced fleet sizing models [24, 25, 26, 40] treat cargo transfer as instantaneous, ignoring the flow-rate-dependent cycle time that is defining for bunkering operations.

2. **No paper** compares port-based ammonia storage (small shuttles, many trips) versus remote supply (large shuttles, long haul, multi-vessel serving) under identical assumptions with a break-even distance analysis. Park and Park [27] compare bunkering *modes* (STS/TTS/PTS) for LNG at a single port but do not compare supply chain *configurations* with distance parameterization.

3. **No paper** models dynamic ammonia bunkering fleet expansion over a multi-decade horizon synchronized with demand growth trajectories, despite fleet renewal models existing for conventional shipping [14, 25], oil shipping [26], LNG bunkering [12, 40, 42], and ammonia supply chains [43].

These three voids correspond directly to Gaps 1, 2, and 3 defined in the research gap statement (Phase 1). The expansion from 17 to 43 papers strengthens rather than weakens these gaps: the additional papers -- including the first ammonia bunkering optimization [38], the most recent ammonia bunkering review [36], and the closest multi-period LNG bunkering MILP [40] -- confirm active research interest in adjacent areas while leaving the ammonia bunkering infrastructure optimization intersection unoccupied.
