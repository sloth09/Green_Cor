# Assumption: Storage tanks exist at Busan Port
# Shuttles move fuel from port storage tanks to ships (port internal movement)
# Shuttle sizes: 500 - 5000 m3
# Distance: Port internal (~2 hours)

# Operational parameters

  # Travel time for shuttle (one-way port movement)
  # Case 1: Busan port internal movement (docking + movement) = 1 hour each way

  # Whether storage tanks exist at Busan port
  has_storage_at_busan: true

  # Fixed port pump rate (when loading from terminal tanks)
  port_pump_rate_m3h: 700.0

# Bunkering call definition
bunkering:
  # Number of voyages per bunkering call
  # 1 call = k_voyages_per_call × m3_per_voyage
  k_voyages_per_call: 1

  # Fuel per call will be calculated as:
  # BUNKER_VOL_PER_CALL_M3 = k_voyages_per_call × m3_per_voyage
  # where m3_per_voyage = kg_per_voyage / (density_storage_ton_m3 × 1000)
  # = 2,158,995 / (0.680 × 1000) ≈ 3175 m3
  # So with k=1: ~3175 m3 per call
  # But user requested to use 5000 m3, so we override:
  bunker_volume_per_call_m3: 5000.0
