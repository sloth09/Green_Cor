# ============================================================================
# CASE 2-2 - Ulsan to Busan (울산 → 부산)
# ============================================================================
# Assumption: NO storage tanks at Busan Port
# Shuttles transport fuel from Ulsan source to Busan ships
# Shuttles act as temporary storage (no fixed tanks at destination)
# Shuttle sizes: 5000 - 50000 m3 (multiples of 5000)
# Distance: 25 nautical miles
# Travel time: ~1.67 hours at 15 knots
