# ============================================================================
# CASE 2 - Ulsan to Busan (울산 → 부산)
# ============================================================================
# Assumption: NO storage tanks at Busan Port
# Shuttles transport fuel from Ulsan source to Busan ships
# Shuttles act as temporary storage (no fixed tanks at destination)
# Shuttle sizes: 5000 - 50000 m3 (multiples of 5000)
# Distance: 59 nautical miles (v4 updated from 25nm)
# Travel time: ~3.93 hours at 15 knots
